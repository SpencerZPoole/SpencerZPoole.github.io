        <h1>How To Claim Your Own Domain</h1>

        <p>Every day, over 100,000 .com domain names are registered. From google.com, apple.com, 
            youtube.com, and thousands more; domain names become memorable destinations that are 
            engrained into our everyday lives. For this reason, to the startup businesses or 
            independent entrepreneur, creating a website can be a vital component to success. 
            In the same hand, claiming a domain name that is simple, catchy, and easy to remember
            is a crucial contributor towards the effectiveness of the site. Once a catchy domain name has
            been chosen, how is it that a business or individual sets up their website's 
            address and actually hosts their content on the world wide web? How would they even check
            if their 'catchy' domain name hasn't already been claimed by someone else?  </p>

        <h1>Registrars</h1>

        <p>The simple truth is that <u>anyone</u> can buy a domain name. All that you have to do is visit
            a <u>domain name registrar</u>, such as <a href=https://www.a2hosting.com/domains>A2</a>,
            <a href=https://www.godaddy.com>GoDaddy</a>, <a href=https://www.namecheap.com>Namecheap</a>,
            or <a href=https://domains.google>Google Domains</a>. At those client-side sites, you can type in 
            and search your custom domain name and check its availability. As long as your domain name suffix
            (".com", ".org", ".dev", etc.) is valid and another person or business hasn't already registered
            your domain name, you can pay a fee and buy your domain! Domains typically cost anywhere from one
            dollar to millions of dollars depending on the demand of your name. CarInsurance.com for example,
            sold for almost 50 million dollars! It is important to note however, that once you pay a fee,
            you are actually <u>renting</u> your domain on a (typically) yearly basis, and it is not actually
            yours to control forever! Most registrars still reserve the right to revoke your rented
            domain name for legal reasons (for example, if you are using your website for illegal or other 
            'unacceptable' purposes). 
            
            <br><br> <b><u>The domain belongs to the registrar</u></b> - not you.
            
            <br><br> Once you have payed the registrar the fee for your domain, the domain name registry 
            must be updated with your information. This simply means that there is typically a 'wait period' before
            your new domain will actually become hosted and available for you to use. While this can take up to 
            7 days, most registrars typically expect a wait period of around 48 hours.
        </p>

        <h1>Alternatives</h1>

        <p>There are, of course, other alternatives to dealing with a registrar. There are 
            <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_hosting_service>web hosting services</a> such
            as <a href=https://www.dreamhost.com>DreamHost</a> that act not only as registrars but offer
            to host your website on private servers and feature-rich platforms. There are also many services 
            that offer domain names and server hosting for free (<a href=https://www.yola.com>yola</a>, 
            <a href=https://www.squarespace.com>Squarespace</a>, <a href=https://www.wix.com>Wix</a>), but the 'free' end of the deal is usually
            accompanied by a 'watermark' on your domain name of some kind.
            
            <br> <br> As a single specific example; instead of 'catchydomain.com', your 'free'
            registrar (named, let's say, 'HosterCo') could force the final domain name for 
            your website to be 'catchydomain.hosterco.com'. 
            
            <br> <br> On the plus side, however, these free web hosting services often provide features 
            (such as visual programming) that make managing and designing your website much easier for 
            the average novice. These tools have limitations in control of your
            website's appearance however, and are usually better left alone by the advanced user. 
            
            <br> <br> A personal recommendation of mine for a 'free' registrar is 
            <a href=https://pages.github.com>GitHub Pages</a>. GitHub Pages allows you to host 
            your website for free from a GitHub repo. If you are already familiar with Git
            and Github, this will make designing, managing, and interacting with your 
            site much easier via a smooth, familiar, and simple workflow. The only 'catch' of the free 
            end of the deal is that your domain name will be the URL of your repo; 
            ie. 'http://username.github.io/repository'. However, if you'd like to use a custom domain 
            name that you have already registered, GitHub pages supports importing and using 
            it for your "GitHub hosted" website.
